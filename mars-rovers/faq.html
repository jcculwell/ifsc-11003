      <h2>Common Questions</h2>

      <h3>Why are rovers sent to Mars?</h3>
      <p>
        Rovers allow scientists to explore the Martian surface directly, study rocks, 
        search for signs of life, and prepare for future human exploration.
      </p>

      <h3>How do rovers communicate with Earth?</h3>
      <p>
        They use orbiters around Mars as relays to send data back to Earth, 
        since direct communication would require enormous power.
      </p>

      <h3>How long do missions last?</h3>
      <p>
        Most rovers are designed for 90 days to 1 Earth year, but many exceed their 
        lifespan — Curiosity and Perseverance are still active today.
