      <h2>Exploring the Surface of Mars</h2>
      <p>
        This website is a student project about NASA’s Mars Rover Program. These rovers were
        sent to Mars to study its rocks, weather, and if life could have ever existed there.
        Each rover helps scientists learn something new about Mars every day.

      <h3>Curiosity Rover</h3>

      <p>
        Curiosity launched in 2011 and landed in 2012 inside Gale Crater. It’s about the size of a car and has
        tools that can test soil and rocks. It found out that Mars used to have water and the right conditions
        that might have supported small life forms.

      <h3>Perseverance Rover</h3>
      <img src="images/perseverance.jpg" alt="Perseverance rover exploring Mars" class="rover-hero">
      <p>
        Perseverance landed in 2021 and is NASA’s most advanced rover yet.
        It’s collecting rock samples to bring back to Earth someday and even
        carried a helicopter named Ingenuity that flew in Mars’ thin air!

      <h4>Why Explore Mars?</h4>
      <p>
        Studying Mars helps us understand more about our solar system and how
        Earth might have looked long ago. It’s also the first step toward
        sending humans to the Red Planet in the future.
